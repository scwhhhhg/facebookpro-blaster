## ✨ Comprehensive Features: Elevate Your Facebook Game

Our bot is packed with cutting-edge features designed to put your Facebook activities on autopilot, allowing you to focus on strategy and creativity while we handle the heavy lifting.

### Core Automation Modules:

-   **🤖 Smart Automation & Scheduling:**
    Forget manual posting! Our intelligent scheduler allows you to set complex timetables for every task. Define specific run times, frequency, and random delays to perfectly mimic human behavior, ensuring consistent engagement without raising red flags.

-   **👥 Multi-Account Management:**
    Seamlessly operate dozens of Facebook accounts from a single, intuitive dashboard. Each account maintains its own unique configuration, schedule, and secure cookies, guaranteeing safe and isolated operations. Scale your reach without the management headache.

-   **🧠 AI-Powered Comments (Google Gemini & OpenRouter Integration):**
    Move beyond generic replies. Our bot integrates with advanced AI models like Google Gemini and OpenRouter to generate relevant, natural, and high-quality comments. Tailor persona styles (friendly, professional, humorous) for authentic interaction that truly resonates.

-   **🔔 Real-time Telegram Notifications:**
    Stay informed, always. Receive instant, real-time reports directly to your Telegram app whenever your bot initiates a task, successfully completes one, or encounters an error. Monitor your operations from anywhere, ensuring peace of mind.

-   **🛡️ Safe & Isolated Execution:**
    Security and stability are paramount. Every task runs within its own isolated process. This robust architecture means if one task encounters an issue, the rest of your operations remain uninterrupted, guaranteeing continuous and stable bot performance.

-   **🍪 Advanced Cookie & Session Management:**
    Automatically generate and refresh browser cookies for each account, including robust support for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This ensures your bot remains securely logged in and operational without the need for repetitive manual logins.

### Detailed Bot Capabilities:

-   **👍 Auto Like:**
    Boost visibility and engagement effortlessly. Our Auto Like module automatically interacts with posts on timelines, groups, or Reels feeds. Configure the number of likes, set randomized intervals, and even filter out unwanted content with keyword blacklists.

-   **🤝 Auto Confirm Friends:**
    Grow your network passively. This feature automatically accepts incoming friend requests, helping you expand your audience. Set daily and hourly limits, and even send personalized greeting messages or stickers to new connections for a human touch.

-   **💬 Auto Comment Group:**
    Drive targeted engagement in Facebook groups. Our bot intelligently comments on posts within specified groups, utilizing AI for contextual and persona-driven replies. It supports Call-to-Action (CTA) links and can optionally auto-like posts it comments on.

-   **↩️ Auto Reply Comments:**
    Maintain active communication around the clock. The Auto Reply module detects and responds to comments or mentions on your posts. Powered by AI, it generates contextual replies, uses a memory system to prevent duplicate responses, and monitors notifications for missed interactions.

-   **📽️ Reels Scraper:**
    Fuel your content strategy. This powerful tool scrapes relevant Facebook Reels URLs from Watch/Reels feeds. It features smart deduplication, data retention, and persistent storage, providing a constant stream of content ideas or sources for your other modules.

-   **📤 Auto Share Reels:**
    Amplify your reach. Automatically share Facebook Reels to your configured target groups. Leverage AI to generate compelling captions in various styles (short, engaging, viral) and smoothly interact with Facebook's UI to maximize distribution.

-   **📝 Auto Update Status (Text & Photo):**
    Keep your profiles fresh and active. Generate unique, time-aware status updates using AI, with the option to upload local photos or automatically download from Unsplash. Our memory system prevents repetitive content, ensuring your posts always feel new.

-   **▶️ Auto Comment Video:**
    Engage with video content effectively. This bot navigates through Facebook videos and Reels, posting intelligent, AI-generated comments. It prevents duplicate comments on the same video and can optionally auto-like videos for increased interaction.

-   **👁️ Auto View Story:**
    Increase passive engagement and visibility. Automatically view Facebook Stories, with configurable viewing limits and durations. Optionally auto-like stories and track viewed content to avoid repetition, all while mimicking natural user behavior.

-   **⬆️ Auto Upload Reels:**
    Streamline your video content pipeline. Automatically upload video Reels to Facebook, complete with AI-generated captions based on your video descriptions.
